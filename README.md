# Daily-Target---Automated-WhatsApp-Messages
This application is developed for an insurance company branch to enhance sales performance through automated WhatsApp messaging. It is designed to keep insurance agents consistently informed and motivated by providing them with real-time updates on their monthly targets and progress. Each agent receives a personalized daily message outlining their monthly goal, the portion they have completed, and how much remains to be achieved.

If there are any ongoing sales competitions, the system also communicates the agentâ€™s current standing, how close they are to completing the competition goals, and provides clear daily action plans to meet those targets within the given timeframe. By breaking down large objectives into manageable daily tasks, the application helps agents stay focused and on track.

The system operates by analyzing the latest available sales data and automatically generating messages every morning, ensuring that agents begin their day with a clear understanding of their progress and what needs to be done. This not only boosts individual productivity but also fosters a sense of accountability and competition among the team. Overall, the application serves as an effective motivational tool to drive consistent performance and improve overall sales outcomes for the branch.
